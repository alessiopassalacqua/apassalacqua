# Biography

My journey in data science started five years ago during my post-doc. In that period, I was working in manufacturing process and Iâ€™ve applied a linear regression to predict the process output from the process parameters. I was impressed by the outcome and the insight we gained. Two years later, after attending specific courses and working on real problems concerning statistical process control, I started a career as data scientist freelance, mainly focusing on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing, and as R trainer. 

Those are my most relevant qualifications and achievements:

* BSc and PhD in Chemistry from University of Modena & Reggio Emilia
* Experience in both academic research and industry.
* Implemented data driven strategies to process control and optimization
* Developed automated anomaly detector to increase efficiency and accuracy of manufacturing process
* Data science/visualization consulting using R and Shiny.
* R trainer for Data Science, Data Mining and Data Visualization course
